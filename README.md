# CorSagAx-Img-Mover

Copies all images from small_png_all_views into corresponding folders on Dropbox, then randomly selects 2000 images from each folder to copy into new (random img) folder for training 

Just change the dest/source/path locations to reuse the script (+ change the wildcard filename suffix for each)
Note that if you run the main copy cells, it will take a while and Dropbox is veryyyy slow to finish syncing
